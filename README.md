#  Knowledge Graphs and NLP: Key Concepts and Applications

This repository captures summaries and key takeaways from selected chapters of two foundational texts in the fields of **knowledge graph** and **natural language processing (NLP)**. The purpose is to provide a reference base for building smarter, grounded, and more reliable AI systems using structured knowledge and large language models (LLMs).

##  Part 1: Knowledge Graphs – Summary of Key Concepts  
 _Based on Chapters 1–2 from_ **Knowledge Graphs**

This section introduces the foundations of knowledge graphs (KGs), focusing on how entities and relationships are modeled using RDF triples and ontologies.

---

##  Part 2: Domain Discovery & Web Information Extraction  
 _Based on Chapters 3 and 5 from_ **Knowledge Graphs**

These chapters focus on how to acquire domain-specific web content and extract structured facts using wrapper-based and learning-based approaches.
 
---

##  Part 3: Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
 _Based on Chapter 4 from_ **Knowledge Graphs**

NER is a foundational step in information extraction, identifying class instances in text using ontology-guided or open approaches.
 
---

##  Chapter 10: LLMs, Errors & Retrieval-Augmented Generation  
 _From_ **Natural Language Processing in Action**

This chapter discusses the power and limitations of LLMs and how to ground their outputs in facts using vector-based retrieval and fine-tuning.
 
---

##  Chapter 11: Information Extraction and Knowledge Graphs  
 _From_ **Natural Language Processing in Action**

This chapter walks through how to extract facts from text and build a knowledge graph for reasoning and grounding LLMs. It emphasizes that while language models sound fluent, they lack true understanding, something that symbolic, structured knowledge systems can support.
