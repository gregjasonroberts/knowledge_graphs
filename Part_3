##  Part 3:  Named Entity Recognition (NER)

This chapter introduces **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** as a core step in transforming unstructured text into structured data for use in knowledge graph (KG) construction. NER identifies and classifies mentions of entities such as people, organizations, and locations—based on a predefined ontology. It forms the backbone of many information extraction (IE) systems that process web pages, legal documents, social media, and more.

NER focuses primarily on extracting **named instances** of classes in a domain ontology, although **unnamed or inferred entities** can also be important. While NER has become a mature area with many successful applications, challenges remain in handling linguistic variability, entity ambiguity, and domain-specific adaptation.

###  Key Concepts

#### 1. Why Information Extraction is Difficult  
IE systems must determine what information is relevant, handle diverse language structures, and map extracted mentions to ontology classes. Text variability across language, format, and platform (e.g., newswire vs. Twitter) makes consistent extraction hard. Additionally, semantic equivalence (e.g., “U.N.” vs. “United Nations”) must be resolved through **instance matching**.

#### 2. NER Techniques: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Deep Learning  
NER is tackled using various approaches:
- **Supervised methods** rely on labeled training data to identify entity types.
- **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)** are used for structured sequence labeling.
- **Unsupervised and semi-supervised** methods reduce dependence on labeled data.
- **Deep learning** approaches (e.g., BiLSTM-CRFs, transformers) have advanced NER accuracy, enabling better generalization and reducing manual feature engineering.

#### 3. Domain-Specific NER and Evaluation

NER systems perform best when tailored to specific domains. In biomedicine, tools like **BANNER**, **ABNER**, and **DrugNER** address the complexity of scientific text, with deep learning models outperforming traditional methods in tasks like **BioCreative**.

Other domains, such as illicit web ads and social media, introduce challenges like noisy text, obfuscated language, and long-tail entities. These require specialized models and data handling. Despite domain differences, most NER approaches rely on shared techniques like sequence labeling with RNNs or transformers.
